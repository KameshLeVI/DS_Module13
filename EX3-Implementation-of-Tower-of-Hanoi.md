# EX3 Implementation of Tower of Hanoi
## DATE: 30-04-2025
## AIM:
To write a C program to implement Tower of Hanoi

## Algorithm

1. Start the program.
 
2.Check if n is greater than 0

3.Recursively move n-1 disks from source (x) to auxiliary (z) using destination (y).

4.Print the move of the n-th disk from source (x) to destination (y).

5.Recursively move n-1 disks from auxiliary (z) to destination (y) using source (x).

6.The function is called initially with TOH(n, 'A', 'B', 'C') where 'A', 'B', and 'C' are the rods.

7.End
   

## Program:
```
/*
Program to implement Tower of Hanoi

#include<stdio.h>
void TOH(int n,char x,char y,char z)
{
  if ( n>0)
  {
      TOH(n-1,x,z,y);
      printf("%c to %c\n", x,y);
      TOH(n-1, z,y,x);
  }
  
}
int main()
{
    
    int n= 3;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    TOH(n ,'A', 'B' , 'C');
}
```

## Result:
Thus, the C program to implement Tower of Hanoi using recursion is implemented successfully.
